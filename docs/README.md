# About Mermaid

**Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.**

It is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

>If you are familiar with Markdown you should have no problem learning [Mermaid's Syntax](./n00b-syntaxReference.md).

<!-- <Main description> -->
Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams.  The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.

> Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.

Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.
But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.<br/>
Mermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).<br/>
 <br/>
Mermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed and diagrams through the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/).<br/>
[Tutorials](./docs/Tutorials.md) has video tutorials.
Use Mermaid with your favorite applications, check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](./docs/integrations.md).

For a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and some of its more basic uses, look to the [Beginner's Guide](./docs/n00b-overview.md) and [Usage](./docs/usage.md).

# Installation

**In depth guides and examples can be found at [Getting Started](/n00b-gettingStarted) and [Usage](/usage).**

**It would also be helpful to learn more about mermaid's [Syntax](/n00b-syntaxReference).**

### CDN

```
https://unpkg.com/mermaid@<version>/dist/
```

To select a version:

Replace `<version>` with the desired version number.

Latest Version: [https://unpkg.com/browse/mermaid@8.8.0/](https://unpkg.com/browse/mermaid@8.8.0/)

## Deploying Mermaid
To Deploy Mermaid:

1. You will need to install node v16, which would have npm
2. Download yarn using npm
3. Enter the following command: `yarn add mermaid`
4. You can then add mermaid as a dev dependency using this command:
    `yarn add --dev mermaid`

## [Mermaid API](./Setup.md):

**To deploy mermaid without a bundler, one can insert a `script` tag with an absolute address and a `mermaidAPI` call into the HTML like so:**

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});
</script>
```
**Doing so will command the mermaid parser to look for the `<div>` tags with `class="mermaid"`. From these tags mermaid will try to read the diagram/chart definitions and render them into svg charts.**

 **Examples can be found at** [Other examples](/examples)

# Sibling projects

## Request for Assistance

Things are piling up and I have a hard time keeping up. It would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate
with the future development of mermaid.

As part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would
represent the project when answering questions and issues.

Together we could continue the work with things like:

- Adding more types of diagrams like mindmaps, ert diagrams, etc.
- Improving existing diagrams

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved!

## For contributors

### Setup

```sh
yarn install
```

### Build

```sh
yarn build:watch
```

### Lint

```sh
yarn lint
```

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/).
We recommend you to install [editor plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) to get real time lint result.

### Test

```sh
yarn test
```
Manual test in browser: open `dist/index.html`

### Release

For those who have the permission to do so:

Update version number in `package.json`.

```sh
npm publish
```

The above command generates files into the `dist` folder and publishes them to npmjs.org.

Mermaid is a growing community and is always accepting new contributors. There's a lot of different ways to help out and we're always looking for extra hands! Look at [this issue](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/866) if you want to know where to start helping out.

## Security and safe diagrams

For public sites, it can be precarious to retrieve text from users on the internet, storing that content for presentation in a browser at a later stage. The reason is that the user content can contain embedded malicious scripts that will run when the data is presented. For Mermaid this is a risk, specially as mermaid diagrams contain many characters that are used in html which makes the standard sanitation unusable as it also breaks the diagrams. We still make an effort to sanitise the incoming code and keep refining the process but  it is hard to guarantee that there are no loop holes.

As an extra level of security for sites with external users we are happy to introduce a new security level in which the diagram is rendered in a sandboxed iframe preventing javascript in the code from  being executed. This is a great step forward for better security.

*Unfortunately you can not have a cake and eat it at the same time which in this case means that some of the interactive functionality gets blocked along with the possible malicious code.*

## Reporting vulnerabilities
To report a vulnerability, please e-mail security@mermaid.live with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.

## Appreciation
A quick note from Knut Sveidqvist:
>*Many thanks to the [d3](https://d3js.org/) and [dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) projects for providing the graphical layout and drawing libraries!*
>*Thanks also to the [js-sequence-diagram](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams) project for usage of the grammar for the sequence diagrams. Thanks to Jessica Peter for inspiration and starting point for gantt rendering.*
>*Thank you to [Tyler Long](https://github.com/tylerlong) who has been a collaborator since April 2017.*
>
>*Thank you to the ever-growing list of [contributors](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/graphs/contributors) that brought the project this far!*
